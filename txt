At Importa Holdings Company Ltd., our vision is simple: Africa should not just participate in global trade—we should lead it. That belief drives everything we build. Today, we are proud to introduce ImportaPay, an AI-powered retail banking app that allows Nigerian retailers to pay their global suppliers in local currency, while suppliers receive their currency seamlessly. And now, we are opening the doors to our beta launch.

Why ImportaPay?

Think about the last time you tried to make an international payment. How long did it take? How much did it really cost after hidden charges and exchange losses? How confident were you that your supplier would get the payment on time? For too long, Nigerian businesses have faced barriers that make global trade unnecessarily difficult:

Hidden fees and poor exchange rates

Long delays that affect trust with global suppliers

Complex banking processes that slow down business

ImportaPay is built to change that. With our platform:

You pay suppliers in your local currency while they receive theirs directly.

Transactions are faster, transparent, and cost-effective.

Every trade is backed by blockchain for accountability and trust.

Built with Trust and Recognition

Trust is the foundation of every financial transaction. That is why we are building ImportaPay with compliance and security at its core.

We are NDPR compliant and aligned with GDPR standards to ensure the protection of user data.

We follow NFIU and AML guidelines, ensuring safe and transparent transactions.

We have secured a UK trademark for ImportaPay, affirming our brand on the global stage.
